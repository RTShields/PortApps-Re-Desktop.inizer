PortableApps Re-Desktop.ini-zer

First off, I love Portable Apps for what it is.

I enjoy having a custom folder to carry my code projects in (who doesn't?) in my [Documents] folder, but whenever I try to make a custom icon for it, it'll disappear when I switched it to a new pc. This program changes the Desktop.ini in [Documents] to what's in the .dll file (provided) by first making sure it exists, then changing the permission setting on the Desktop.ini and rewriting it before hiding it again.

The folders are ordered as follows: Coding, Downloads, Music, Pictures, Video
